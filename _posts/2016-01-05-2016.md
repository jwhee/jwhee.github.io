The new resolution is 720p... which is slightly less than last year.

No really. Last year I told myself to write 2 posts per month, and one can easily tell that I did not achieve my goal.

Here are my excuses:

1. Monster Hunter 4U
2. Heroes of the Storm launch and 30-day stimpack discount
3. Diablo 3 patch 2.3 and season 4 cross promotion
4. Overwatch closed beta

In short, I spent too much time gaming.

My new goal for this year is **write 1 post per month**. I also need to cut down some game time, which means I have to be very selective about what to play. Games that require a lot of grinding and mindless button-smashing will be cut (I'm looking at you, Diablo. Sorry. Not sorry.). I'd prefer games that require more thinking, planning, and strategizing. 

Happy 2016!
