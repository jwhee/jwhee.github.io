Here's the crazy news... I've joined the Hearthstone team!

This is a huge milestone for my career. A great opportunity came up in late October last year, so I applied for the position without blinking an eye. After almost three months of hiring process (the holiday seasons are in the blame), I got an offer to transfer to the Hearthstone team as a tools engineer.

...and here I am, sitting next to the giants behind Hearthstone!

In retrospective, the interview process was quite enjoyable. I met with many key personals on the team - directors, managers, producers, and lead engineers. They were all extremely welcoming and friendly, to a point where I almost felt that I was already part of their team.

The interviews focus mainly on cultural fit. Most of the inteview questions were behavioral - "Why Hearthstone?", "Tell me about a time when you are under stress", "What's your favorite engineering project so far?"...etc.

Since I was applying for a technical position, I was expecting a lot more technical questions and brain teasers... but I didn't get many, surprisingly. Of all 6 rounds of interviews, I only got one real technical question - which is a tree problem that [Mike Schweitzer](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Michael_Schweitzer) himself just solved days ago prior to the interview.

At the last round of interviews, I mentioned to [Jay Baxter](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Jay_Baxter), one of the intervewers (and now my coworker!), that I am surprised that I didn't get as many technical questions as I expected. He looked at me with a smile. "If you find an engineer who enjoys learning and goes to hackathon and talks about different technology with a passion, you'd know that he will learn how to do his job", he answered.

Boy, and I was flattered.

Now, I work at a place where I can constantly hear [Ben Brode's loud laughters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOa-YmYZcTM). Worth it. Totally.
