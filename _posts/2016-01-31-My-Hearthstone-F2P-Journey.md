### The beginning of a free-to-play (F2P) journey
I have been playing lots of Hearthstone lately.

My last obsession in Hearthstone peaked around May 2014, and then I temporarily dropped out around the release of Naxxaramas adventure, when the meta completely re-shuffled. Don't be mistaken - I had a lot of fun playing Hearthstone back in 2014. I popped a lot of real money on card packs simply to collect all of the cards (I ended up owning 95% of the classic sets!) I "netdecked" to try out many competitive meta decks. I wrecked a few innocent players on ranked mode with my shiny legendary netdecks. "Wow, so this is how you win!", I thought. "Buy card packs. Get better cards. Netdeck. Win." At that moment, I believed that I had completely learned the gist of Hearthstone. Soon, I lost interest and moved on.

As a company man, I have made various attempts to introduce my friends to Hearthstone, but none was successful. "Oh, [Hearthstone is] a free-to-play card game? Meh, it's probably [a] pay-to-win [game]," as one of my hardcore gamer friend refused to invest himself in yet another F2P game. Likewise, many of my friends got scared away from Hearthstone once they knew the game is monetizing by selling card packs, and soon decided that Hearthstone is not worthy for their precious time.

In a nutshell, it was fairly challenging for me to promote Hearthstone when I have only played Hearthstone from the paid user's perspective.

I wanted to prove that Hearthstone is a game that can be enjoyable regardless whether a person paid money or not, so I created a smurf account that is dedicated for the F2P experience.

It's been about one month since the beginning of my F2P journey. This post will call out some important experiences I have so far.

### Losing in Hearthstone is normal
People have argued whether Hearthstone is "pay-to-win" or "pay-to-win-faster" for months now. This argument assumes that "winning" is the one-and-only way to enjoy Hearthstone. What we often forget is that Hearthstone is not all about winning.

In my opinion, Hearthstone did *not* communicate this very well, so it may seem like the game emphasizes solely on winning. For example, the majority of the common daily quests require a player to "win" games in PvP modes. Tavern Brawl requires a "win" to earn a free card pack. Not to mention that the Arena mode yields better rewards by "winning" more games. In this reward structure, players would begin to unconsciously make the short-circuited conclusion that "winning" is a requirement to enjoy Hearthstone. As a result, when losing a game to a deck with better rarity cards, players become easily frustrated and begin accusing Hearthstone for being "pay-to-win".

To some extent, losing is perfectly normal in Hearthstone, so one should not mistakenly treat "winning" as the predominant way to enjoy Hearthstone. In a theorectical world, a match-maker would match a player with equally-skilled opponent, which suggests that the expected win-lose ratio is 1:1. Therefore, losing a match would happen just as frequently as winning a match, so it would be silly to make a huge deal about losing.

Once I reminded myself that "losing is OK", I found myself enjoying playing Hearthstone a lot more. I focus less about the match outcome, but instead I pay more attention to progressing my player skill. Losing is not a failure, but a learning opportunity.

### Learning the fundamentals
Using the F2P account, I've learned a lot more about the fundamentals and theories behind competitive card games, more than I ever had with my paid account. 

The Basic set, being a much smaller subset of Hearthstone's massive card collection, is an important learning tool that every Hearthstone player should spend some time with. There are a substantial ammount of unspoken wisdom and knowledge in the Basic minions:

#### 1. What is the golden ratio for minions?
The golden ratio refers to the 1:2 ratio between mana cost of a minion to the overall stats sum (Attack plus Health) of the minion. It is a good preliminary test to examine a minion's value and effectiveness. For example, a 3-mana 3/3 is a good minion, because the sum of its attack and health is 6, which doubles its mana cost and passes the golden-ratio test. A 3-mana 3/4 would be considered an amazing minion, because the stats sum exceeds the golden ratio. On the other end of spectrum, a 3-mana 2/2 would be terrible, because it doesn't pass the golden-ratio test.

#### 2. Why is the Chillwind Yeti (4 mana 4/5) considered a good minion?
First of all, **Chillwind Yeti** has amazing stats that exceeds the golden ratio, because it has 9 total stats for its 4-mana cost. Its 5 health makes Yeti very durable, usually forcing the opponent to trade 2 minions to kill the Yeti (a.k.a. 2-for-1). Its 4 attack helps effectively clearing enemy's minions that cost less than 4 mana. Thus, we consider **Chillwind Yeti** to have a great stats distribution, and therefore it's a great minion that becomes a usual stable card in Basic decks to fill the 4-mana spot.

#### 3. Why is the Magma Rager (3 mana 5/1) considered a bad minion?
**Magma Rager** passes the golden ratio test, as it has 6 total stats for its 3-mana cost. However, its stats distribution is terrible. At the first glance, its 5 attack seems very powerful. However, its 1 health basically means that **Magma Rager** will die from any kinds of attack, leaving it extremely vulnerable. Thus, we consider **Magma Rager** to be an ineffective minion, and we can only find its name in Hearthstone guides as an example to tell the story of terrible stats distribution.

#### 4. What is the stratigical difference between River Crocolisk (2 mana 2/3) and Bloodfen Raptor (2 mana 3/2)?
**River Crocolisk** and **Bloodfen Rapter** both exceeds the golden-ratio, so are both cost-effective minions. However, they have stats distributions that are exactly the reverse of each other. In practice, they are both amazing minions, but serving different purposes. **River Crocolisk** is the little cousine of **Chillwind Yeti**, having a slightly more health than other 2-mana minions. This means that **River Crocolisk** has the potential of forcing a 2-for-1, or the opponent needs to use a 3-mana minion to kill it. On the other hand, **Bloodfen Raptor** has an attack value which is usually equal to the health of 3-mana minions, allowing **Bloodfen Rapter** to "trade-up", a concept of using a lower-cost minion to kill a higher-cost enemy minion to trade favorably.

### Piloting Basic-only decks

The art behind deck-building is something that I have not fully grapsed yet, which is slated for later in my F2P journey. Yet again, I shamelessly consulted the greater internet, and found [Trump's guide on basic-only decks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KjtRokhpvM&list=PLvEIxIeBRKSjprrvlbAcbVjzHsnH9PjDX) (Yes, I netdecked again, but this time with only Basic cards). More importantly, I want to pilot a vanilla, easy-to-understand deck, while learning the essential strategical concepts of a Hearthstone match:

#### Card advantage
The card advantage is the easiest concept to understand. You have card advantage if you have more cards, both in play and in hands, than your opponent. In theory, the more cards you have, you may make better responses and reactions to your opponent's moves.

#### Mana advantage
In theory, the person who uses mana more efficiently wins the game. If you waste any mana in your turns, then you didn't maximize your resource usage and would put yourself behind your opponent.

#### Board control
Board control refers to having more active minions in play than your opponent. Usually the player owning board control has the advantage. Having board control allows you to make favorable trades with your opponent, as well as dealing constant damages to opponent's hero to ultimately winning a game.

#### Use spells and weapons as minion removal
A common beginner's mistake is using spells and weapons to deal face damage on the opponent's hero in early game. The correct way to use spells and weapons is to remove opponent's minions so that you establish and maintain board control. You should only deal spell/weapon damange to the enemy hero as a finisher in late game.

#### Use health as a resource
This is a somewhat advanced concept - Your health is also a resource, especially in early game. Many beginners would be afraid to take hero damage, but in fact you may want to trade health to establish other kinds of advantage. For instance, as a Warlock class, your hero power allows you to trade health to gain card advantage, spending 2 health to draw a card. As a weapon class (i.e. Warrior, Rogue, Paladin..etc), you may often want to equip a weapon to remove enemy minions to establish board control. Health is a valuable resource, and you may gain an edge over your opponent by favorably trading your hero's health.

#### Tempo advantage
This is the most abstract concept. The tempo advantage is also often called a move advantage. It refers to being one or more "moves" ahead of your opponent, allowing you to be proactive and initiative while putting your opponent behind in the reactive state.

None of above concept was apparent to me when I was playing with my paid account, as I was blinded by card rarity and special effect synergies. Piloting basic-only decks forces me to do my homework thoroughly, which ultimately helps me learn and grow into a better Hearthstone player.

### The First Checkpoint
I am at the first checkpoint of my F2P journey. I have earned all the one-time-only gold from unique missions, leaving daily quests as my only stable source of gold from now on. I have unlocked the Tavern Brawl to start earning my free Classic pack every week. I have saved enough gold to buy the first two wings of Naxxaramas, and defeated the normal-mode bosses with my Basic-only mage. I have ranked from 25 to 20 without a sweat, but I'm also at a point where the match-maker begins to throw me at challenging opponents who have fancier decks.

This F2P journey will be long journey. Unlike my paid account, this F2P account won't have the luxury of shortcutting with competitive meta decks. However, I'm glad that I spend the time to fully explore the Basic cards, and in return I have learned so much more about Hearthstone.
