The Charge Blade is a surprisingly deep and complex weapon introduced in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, the latest installment of the Monster Hunter series. Concept-wise, it is depicted that the Charge Blade is very much like the Switch Axe, with the ability to morph from one weapon to the other. However, in real game play, the Charge Blade is more than just a convertible weapon. As I dive into the Charge Blade's mechanics, I soon noticed that many design aspects from other weapons were combined into the Charge Blade's design. In this blog post, let's briefly look at how each melee weapon in Monster Hunter series is designed, and how some of these designs are embedded into the Charge Blade.

### The Foundation
In the original Monster Hunter, there are only four melee weapons: the Sword and Shield (SnS), the Great Sword (GS), the Hammer, and the Lance. These four weapons may appear a bit mundane in comparison to other weapons, but they are the foundation of the Monster Hunter's weapon design.

The Sword and Shield is best known for its mobility and versatility. Attacks are short and fast, and thus one can evade monster attacks easily. In cases when one cannot move out of monster attack range, SnS can also use its small shield to partially block the incoming damage. While SnS may not appear to deal a lot of damage, its flexible attack rhythm makes it a really agile weapon.

The Great Sword, on the contrary, is a much slower weapon, but best known for its burst damage. Its attack combos are extremely slow, but with wider range and hit a lot harder per hit. The basic attack routine for GS users is "Hit and Run" - The player would run to the correct position, launch a heavy attack, roll away and sheath the weapon, and then back to running and re-positioning. Rinse and repeat. GS can also block damage with the blade at the cost of weapon sharpness.

The Hammer is the supportive weapon of the four. Each hammer hit does a special type of damage - exhaust. The exhaust damage will drain the monster's stamina, making the monster easily to become tired so that there are more openings for other players to land attacks. Furthermore, the monster will be stunned when enough exhaust damage is applied on its head, leaving even larger offensive opportunities. Unlike the other three weapons, the Hammer cannot block attacks and cannot cut tails.

The Lance is all about blocking attacks and performing counter attacks. The Lance cannot disengage quickly like the other weapons, but in return it has the best shield in the game. The Lance's shield has a large blocking radius and damage reduction amount. Instead of an evasion-based game play, the Lance is excels at defensive game play with its blocking and countering mechanics.

So here are the three foundations for weapon design:

* **Attack rhythm** - Is the weapon dealing constant sustained damage (like SnS) or burst damage (like GS)?
* **Damage type** - Does the weapon deal cutting damage to allow tail cutting? Does the weapon deal exhaustive damage for a more supportive gameplay?
* **Defensive style** - Can the weapon block damage or not? Is the shield as good as the Lance? or is it cheap like the SnS?

### Stateful Weapons
On top of the foundations, newer melee weapons all come with its own alternative state mechanics: The Dual Sword is about alternating between Demon Mode and Archdemon mode. The Long Sword is about maintaining the spirit level as high as possible at all times. The Switch Axe is about effective effective use of Axe mode and Sword mode between different energy level. The Hunting Horn is about playing and collecting different notes to generate beneficial buff. The Gun Lance is about loading and unloading gun shells, and occasional launching the massive wyvern fire ultimate attack. Each system is distinct, and that makes each weapon unique.

These new weapons can be considered as a modification or upgrade to one of the original four weapons:

* The Dual Sword is a stateful SnS without a shield, but comes with a bursty Demon Dance attack that is comparable to the GS charge attack.
* The Long Sword is a stateful GS without the ability to block, but comes with faster attack rhythm.
* The Switch Axe is also a stateful GS without the ability to block, and some Switch Axe can also deal exhaust damage.
* The Hunting Horn is a stateful Hammer that provides even more team-oriented supportive gameplay options
* The Gun Lance is a stateful lance with the mechanics of bowguns.

### The Insect Glaive
There are two new weapons in MH4U: the Insect Glaive and the Charge Blade. Interestingly, neither of them seem to follow the usual formula of a mere upgrade to one of the original four weapons. Instead, the Insect Glaive has its own state management system that feels much like Hunting Horn's self buff and Dual Swords Archdemon mode. Also, the ability to pole vault and jump attack is what makes the Insec Glaive so unique. Notice how I didn't mention any of the four original weapon when I talk about the Glaive; it is pretty much a unique design of evasion-based weapon in this new generation.

### The Charge Blade
If the Glaive is the evasion-based weapon in this new generation, then the Charge Blade is the blocking-based weapon. However, unlike how the Gliave feels almost like a uniquely new weapon, the Charge Blade feels more like an amalgamation of all the existing weapons.

* **Infinite Combo** - The CB has infinite combo that makes it as versatile as the SnS/DS
* **Sword mode** - This plays like a SnS with fast combos and a shield that's equivalent to the GS block. Blocking also decreases weapon sharpness like GS
* **Charge attack** - This is like LS's spirit combo
* **Axe mode** - This plays like the switch axe. Slower attack with wider range
* **Boost mode** - When the shield goes into boost mode, the shield is equivalent to the Lance shield. Moreover, the Axe deals more damage, which is like DS/LS/HH's self buff system
* **Guard Point** - When doing morph attacks, there's actually guard points which will auto block incoming attack. This is a weaker version of Lance's counter attack
* **Side step** - CB side steps like the Dual Sword and Lance
* **Elemental Burst** - The reload and burst attack feels much like the Gun Lance
* **Impact phial** - Some CB comes with impact phial, which will deal exhaust damage and stun monsters like the Hammer
* **Ultra Elemental Burst** - The ultimate attack, much like the Gun Lance's wyvern fire and Switch Axe's elemental burst

Notice how the Charge Blade's design contains so many different aspects of different weapons. This is why I enjoy playing it more than the Insect Glaive. The Charge Blade is arguably the most complicated weapon yet in the Monster Hunter series so far, and it will take a long time to really master the depth of Charge Blade.

Bring it on! My body is ready!
