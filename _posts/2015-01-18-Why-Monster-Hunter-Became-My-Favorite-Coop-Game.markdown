[Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_4) is coming to North America on February 13th, and the carving hype is real. It's been almost two full years since the last Monster Hunter released in the states. Two years is just too long.

As much of a hardcore MH player I'd think I am, I must shamefully admit that I've never played [MHFU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Freedom_Unite), the title that really defined the franchise. My very first Monster Hunter experience was with [MHTri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Tri) on Nintendo Wii back in 2010. Coming from a [Dynasty Warriors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_Warriors) hack'n'slash background, I soon found myself being punished by Monster Hunter's unforgiving boss mechanics. Despite the many painful deaths of felyne karts, Monster Hunter soon became my favorite cooperative game of all time.

Why? Let's talk about why...

### The Hunting Action Genre
In recent years, two new sub-genres were born from traditional Action-RPG: In the competitive e-sports scene, we have the [MOBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena) genre with notable games like [League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) and [DOTA2](http://blog.dota2.com/). In the co-operative gaming category, we have the Hunting Action genre, which is where Monster Hunter falls into. It's almost safe to say that Monster Hunter is the father of the Hunter Action genre, with subsequent followers like [Gods Eater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gods_Eater_Burst), [Ragnarok Odyssey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Odyssey), [Soul Sacrifice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Sacrifice_%28video_game%29), [Freedom War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Wars), and more.

The premise of the Hunter Action genre is simple: A third-person action game where four players form a party to fight cooperatively against a giant, bad-ass boss monster. It's a simple concept, but the depth of Monster Hunter's game design is immense.

### Avoiding the Numbered-Levelling Model
We play games because we like to progress toward a goal. Many of traditional RPGs abstracts progression in a numbered-levelling system - As you spend time playing the game, you earn an abstracted resource called "experience points", and then these "experience points" are converted to other resource like "skill points" or "ability points" to empower the player's virtual character.

To ridicule the numbered-levelling system, we are basically spending time watching a number on the screen to increment, so that after a short-while another number on the other side of the screen can also increment. We are no longer playing a game, but instead we are being tricked by the poorly designed progression model. Worst of all, the grind is merely a waste of our valuable gaming time.

Ditching the numbered-levelling model, Monster Hunter takes a different approach on character progression. As you defeat a monster, you earn monster parts as resources to forge better equipment and weapons. As you earn better equipments and weapons, you can then challenge harder monsters to earn even better parts, and the reward cycle continues on. The character's strength is no longer determined by one single number on a screen, but rather it is short-circuited to be represented by the character's equipment statistics.

The combination of reward loop and progression works extremely well. Monster Hunter focuses on letting players to progress through loots and rewards, and this design feels much more rewarding than watching an ever-incrementing progress bar.


### Player Skill as Progression
Abstracting the strength growth of the virtual character is one way to design the progression model of a game. However, what really makes Monster Hunter's gameplay such a love-and-hate experience is its clever design around player skill progression.

One major barrier of entry in earlier Monter Hunter titles is undoubtedly its unforgiving requirement on player skills. Spoiled by mainstream action games, we are often trap inside the misconception that "the faster you smash your buttons, the more enemies you can defeat". Monster Hunter is going to shatter that delusion for new comers very, very quickly.

Monster Hunter's gameplay requires careful observation, planning, and execution. The combat mechanic is basically a fighting game: Different button combinations
yield different moves, with ending animation that renders the character vulnerable for a few short frames. Powerful attacks and finishers tend to have longer delay, so advanced players would chain the attacks effectively to cancel the animation as much as possible. However, if timed incorrectly, you will get caught in the monster's attack, and then you will distaste yourself for stupidly pulling off a bad move. Luckily, the monsters' movement pattern are not to difficult to learn, and it quickly turns into a real-time, risk-and-return game: Do you want to sheath your weapon now to take potion? Do you want to put down a few lighter hits and quickly roll away? or do you want to risk it all and launch a heavy finisher? The decision is all yours.

Each weapon type represents different movement sets, and each monster represents different mechanics and movement patterns. Putting both aspects together creates a humongous player skill progression model. In the upcoming Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, there are 14 weapon types and 73 boss monsters. Multiplicatively, that's more than 1000 combinations to master!

### Breaking out of the Trinity
Many multiplayer games in the past couple years are designed around the [Trinity](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132607/rethinking_the_trinity_of_mmo_.php?print=1), which breaks responsibilities crucial to a group's success into three different roles: the tank, the healer, and the damage dealer. This design has proven to be widely adopted, as observed in popular MMO such as [World of Warcraft](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/), and even in recent MOBA games like League of Legends. By distributing responsibilities across party members, the game requires players to work together, which of course is the intent of multiplayer games - working as a team.

Despite the Trinity is widespread across various games and arguably proven successful, the design has one major problem - it introduces multiple single-point-of-failures. When each team member is crucial to the success of the group, any small mistakes can result in a catastrophe. A team can lose a game if the tank isn't absorbing damage correctly, or if the healer isn't managing spells effectively, or if the damage dealer isn't doing enough damage output. That's too many IFs in one equation, and the isolation of roles generates unwanted stress on each player, and even catalyses toxic behavior toward players who failed to fulfil their role's responsibility. As a result, playing games become stressful and frustrating at times, which defeats the purpose of gaming.

The trinity design made it mandatory for teamwork to be accomplished within mundane, mistake-intolerant roles. Sure, sure, the design separates the advanced players from the amateur, and that's what makes it so exciting to watch professional e-sports, because we all understand how difficult it is to achieve such meticulous team work. However, when it comes to making a fun, enjoyable cooperative game, we should break out of the trinity design.

Monster Hunter's cooperative multiplayer mode is vastly enjoyable because it does not force the trinity on players. Instead of role separation, every player has the same primary role: the damage dealer. The boss monster will periodically target another random player, so there is no need for a dedicated tank role. It's each player's own responsibility to dodge or block the incoming attack. In addition, if a player prefers a more supportive play style, he/she can then choose a more team-oriented weapon. For instance, one can opt for using a Hunting Horn with healing songs, or choosing a paralysis Hammer to both knock-out and paralyse the monster easily.

In Monster Hunter, everyone is the damage dealer, everyone would need to tank some damages from time to time, and anyone can opt for being a little more supportive. Everyone has the same role and has the same responsibility: enjoy hunting! That's what makes Monster Hunter's multiplayer so much fun.

### Sum it up!
There are much more that can be descussed about Monster Hunter's game design, but we have covered the core elements. Monster Hunter has a rewarding character levelling system, a deep player-skill progression model that provides countless replayability, and most importantly, an enjoyable cooperative online multiplayer gameplay. With all these aspects, Monster Hunter has become my favorite cooperative game of all time.

I cannot wait to have my hands on Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate!
