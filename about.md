### Who are you?
My name is Jerry. I currently work at Blizzard Entertainment as a software engineer. There are many programming disciplines that interest me: natural language processing, machine learning, algorithm, web application, test-driven development, server-client architecture... and more!

I am always looking out for new challenges!

### Oh! So you work for...
Sorry to cut you off there! Yes, I am a Blizzard employee. However, whatever I say here is solely my own opinion. No, I don't have a beta key for you.

### Why blog?
I want to write down programming techniques I've learned. I want to talk about geeky things. I want to share my opinions. Years later, I want to be able to look back and say "wow! I can't believe the past-me was THAT silly!"
